Progress Update Wed Feb 2:

Started/Working on integration of communication subsystem with application subsystem
2nd and 3rd motor controller and power supplies have been constructed - awaiting microcontroller to power the motors
Working on signal strength indicator for antenna subsystem - lacks stability currently 
Working on calculating error rate for triangulated location will begin after integration - requires antenna subsystem operating optimally so measurements can be taken and full integration of all subsystems so data can be collected for error rate
